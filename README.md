# challenge-04-code-quiz

## Description

As a web developer in training I wanted to create a project that utilized HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

To do that, I built a small application that allows the user to take a short quiz over JavaScript concepts.

The building of this quiz allowed me to utilize the skills I have learned in JavaScript as well as identify areas that I am lacking in. I have made note of various concepts to follow up on and practice with.

In the course of building this project, I learned that there is a lot that goes into JavaScript, and that it is a powerful tool to know. I am continually impressed with the things that you can accomplish with JavaScript. It was fairly easy to pick up the concepts, but very important that you have a good understanding of how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript interact with one another. That part was a little more daunting for me to get a grasp on. As such I will continue to work on this project to learn and practice other concepts like creating a list of high scores versus just showing the last one.
